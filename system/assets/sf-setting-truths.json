					"Details": "The experimental drives used by the Exodus fleet are forbidden, but the damage is done. The Sundering spreads across our reality like cracks on the surface of an icy pond. Those fissures unleash even more perilous realities upon our own. Did we flee one cataclysm, only to inadvertently create another?",

Today, the Ironsworn swear vows upon the shards to honor the sacrifice of their forebears, the essence of the places left behind, and the souls of those great ships.",

Remnants of this prized resource are found within ancient sites throughout the Forge. It is resistant to damage and corrosion, but can be molded using superheated plasma at specialized facilities. The Ironsworn carry weapons, armor, or tokens crafted from black iron, and swear vows upon it.",

					"Chance": 100,
					"Description": "The Ironsworn bind their honor to iron blades.",
					"Details": "Aboard a starship, where stray gunfire can destroy fragile equipment or pierce hulls, the brutal practicality of a sword makes for a useful weapon. A few also favor the silent efficiency of a blade for infiltration or espionage. Most importantly, when the Ironsworn swear a vow upon a sword, they bind their commitment to the metal. If they forsake a vow, that iron must be abandoned. To be Ironsworn without a blade is to be disgraced.",

					"Quest Starter": "In the upper atmosphere of a gas giant, transport vehicles carry valuable and volatile fuel from the processing plant to a heavily guarded storage depot. The notorious leader of a criminal organization needs this fuel, and gives you the schedule for the transports. What leverage does this person hold over you? How will you undertake this heist?"

				{
					"Chance": 100,
					"Description": "Our communities are bound under the terms of the Covenant, a charter established after the Exodus. The organization called the Keepers is sworn to uphold those laws.",
					"Details": "Most settlements are still governed under the Covenant and yield to the authority of the Keepers. But a few view the Covenant as a dogmatic, impractical, and unjust relic of our past; in those places, the Keepers find no welcome.",
					"Quest Starter": "A Keeper abuses their authority to take control of a settlement, and rules with an iron fist. What do they seek to gain there?"
				}

			"Character": "If you chase down outlaws, you might be a BOUNTY HUNTER. If you are skilled at getting in and out of protected places and systems, you might be an AGENT.

					"Details": "The Exodus was a tipping point. The gods offered no help to the billions who died in the cataclysm, and spirituality has little meaning in the Forge. Most now see religion as a useless relic of our past. But the search for meaning continues, and many are all-too-willing to follow a charismatic leader who claims to offer a better way.",
					"Quest Starter": "A charismatic leader claims to have harnessed a technology which offers new hope to the people of the Forge. What is this innovation? What is your relationship to this person or their followers? What grave danger do they pose?"
				},
				{
					"Chance": 67,
					"Description": "Our faith is as diverse as our people.",
					"Details": "Many have no religion, or offer an occasional prayer out of habit. Others pay homage to the gods of our forebears as a way of connecting to their roots. Some idealize the natural order of the universe, and see the divine in the gravitational dance of stars or the complex mechanisms of a planetary ecosystem. And many now worship the Primordials—gods of a fallen people who once dwelt within the Forge.",
					"Quest Starter": "A cult seeks to take control of a site reputed to hold a Primordial artifact. What holy object do they seek? Why are you sworn to stop them?"
				},
				{
					"Chance": 100,
					"Description": "Three dominant religious orders, the Triumvirate, battle for influence and power within the Forge.",
					"Details": "Our communities are often sworn to serve one of the three doctrines of the Triumvirate. For many, faith offers purpose and meaning. But it also divides us. Throughout our brief history in the Forge, the leaders of the Triumvirate have pitted us against each other. For this reason, some are apostates who disavow these religions and follow a different path.",
					"Quest Starter": "You bear the mark of one of the gods of the Triumvirate. What is it? Priests declare this as a sign you are chosen to fulfill a destiny. Do you accept this fate, and swear to see it through, or are you determined to see it undone? What force opposes you?"

					"Chance": 100,
					"Description": "Unnatural energies flow through the Forge. Magic and science are two sides of the same coin.",
					"Details": "Soon after our arrival, some displayed the ability to harness the Forge's energies. Today, mystics invoke this power to manipulate matter or see beyond the veils of our own universe. But this can be a corrupting force, and the most powerful mystics are respected and feared in equal measure.",

					"Details": "Direct communication and transmissions beyond the near-space of a ship or outpost is impossible. Digital archives are available at larger outposts, but the information is not always up-to-date or reliable. Therefore, the most important communications and discoveries are carried by couriers who swear vows to see that data safely to its destination.",

					"Details": "Ascendancy vaults can appear spontaneously, washed up like flotsam in the tides of time. Their gravity and atmospheres pay no heed to natural laws. Some are corrupted and ruined. Others are unmarred and intact. Some are both at once. They are chaos.",
					"Quest Starter": "Deep in the Forge, an Ascendancy beacon has activated. The mysterious signal has confounded translation. Why are you sworn to seek out the source of the signal? What other person or faction opposes you?"

					"Description": "The biomechanical lifeforms we call the Remnants, engineered by ancient civilizations as weapons in a cataclysmic war, survived the death of their creators.",
					"Details": "On scarred planets and within ancient vaults throughout the Forge, the Remnants still guard ancient secrets and fight unending wars.",
					"Quest Starter": "A xenoarcheologist studying precursor vaults has discovered a powerful form of Remnant. What is the nature of this being? What force seeks to take control of it?"

					"Description": "Put enough alcohol in a spacer, and they’ll tell you stories of ghost ships crewed by vengeful undead. It’s nonsense.",
					"Details": "Within the Forge, space and time are as mutable and unstable as a flooding river. When reality can't be trusted, we are bound to encounter unsettling phenomenon.",
					"Quest Starter": "You receive urgent distress calls from a ship stranded in the event horizon of a black hole. The ship itself is broken apart—a shattered hull trailing debris. There are no signs of life. And yet the ghostly messages persist."

					"Description": "Most insist that horrors aren’t real. Spacers know the truth.",
					"Details": "When you travel the depths of the Forge, be wary. Death is not always the end to our suffering. Some say we are cursed by those who did not survive the cataclysm, and the veil between life and death is forever weakened. Supernatural occurrences and entities are especially common near a white dwarf star. These stellar objects, which spacers call ghost lights, are the decaying remnants of a dead star.",
					"Quest Starter": "A group of settlers established a home in an abandoned orbital station under the light of a white dwarf star. The previous inhabitants were killed in a raider attack years ago, but it seems the dead do not rest there. The people are plagued by constant mechanical issues, strange noises, and unsettling visions."

They are driven by hate and a hunger for the warmth of life which is forever lost to them. The Soulbinders are dedicated to putting them to rest—whatever the cost.",
					"Quest Starter": "Rumors persist of a fleet of ghost ships, bound for settled domains. Who is said to lead this corrupted armada? Why do they seek revenge against the living?"
