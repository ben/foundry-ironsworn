  REGION:
    Description: 'The Forge is divided broadly into four regions. The choices you made when you selected your campaign truths will influence how you envision the regions and the people who live there.

      Label: Outlands

    TERMINUS:
      Description: Settlements are relatively common here, and spaceborne routes between communities are usually well-charted. <strong>If you want to focus on interacting with other people and communities, start here.</strong>
      Label: Terminus
      Lore: Your people landed in this region following their exodus from their home galaxy. Settlements are common here. Factions compete for resources, and spaceborne caravans follow charted paths among the stars. But the Forge is a vast galaxy; even here, there are still unknown and isolated domains.
    Title: Select region
    VOID:
      Description: In the reaches beyond the Forge, isolated stars are separated by vast gulfs of nothing. Travel and settling here is impractical if not impossible. Don’t start your campaign here.
