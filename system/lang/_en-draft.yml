  REGION:
    Choose: Choose your region
    Description: 'The Forge is divided broadly into four regions. The choices you made when you selected your campaign truths will influence how you envision the regions and the people who live there. But the relative differences between the regions will remain the same: The Terminus is where the bulk of your people live, the Outlands is an expanding frontier, and the Expanse is what lies beyond.'
    EXPANSE:
      Description: Only a few bold pioneers have delved these far-flung reaches. <strong>If you’re ready to face the dangers of lonely exploration within uncharted space, start here.</strong>
      Label: Expanse
      Lore: A few bold pioneers have delved the far-flung reaches of the Forge. Isolated settlements have been built among these distant domains, but they are usually lost and disconnected from the settled regions.
    OUTLANDS:
      Description: This region represents an area of recent expansion. Settlements here are scattered, and navigational paths are often uncharted and perilous. <strong>If you envision yourself as a spacer on a wild frontier, start here.</strong>
      Label: Outlands
      Lore: In the last few decades, your people have pushed deeper into the galaxy, searching for habitable planets, resources, and opportunities. Settlements within the Outlands are scattered, and navigation paths are often uncharted.
    TERMINUS:
      Description: Settlements are relatively common here, and spaceborne routes between communities are usually well-charted. <strong>If you want to focus on interacting with other people and communities, start here.</strong>
      Label: Terminus
      Lore: Your people landed in this region following their exodus from their home galaxy. Settlements are common here. Factions compete for resources, and spaceborne caravans follow charted paths among the stars. But the Forge is a vast galaxy; even here, there are still unknown and isolated domains.
    VOID:
      Description: In the reaches beyond the Forge, isolated stars are separated by vast gulfs of nothing. Travel and settling here is impractical if not impossible. Don’t start your campaign here.
      Label: Void
      Lore: Beyond the Forge, there are only a few isolated stars and vast gulfs of nothing. Travel beyond the periphery of the Forge is difficult or impossible.
