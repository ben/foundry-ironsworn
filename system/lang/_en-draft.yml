      Label: Terminus
      Lore: Your people landed in this region following their exodus from their home galaxy. Settlements are common here. Factions compete for resources, and spaceborne caravans follow charted paths among the stars. But the Forge is a vast galaxy; even here, there are still unknown and isolated domains.
    Title: Select region
    VOID:
      Description: In the reaches beyond the Forge, isolated stars are separated by vast gulfs of nothing. Travel and settling here is impractical if not impossible. Don’t start your campaign here.
