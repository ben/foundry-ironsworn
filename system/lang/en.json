        "option2": "We live in communities called circles. These are settlements ranging in size from a steading with a few families to a village of several hundred. Some circles belong to nomadic folk. Some powerful circles might include a cluster of settlements. We trade (and sometimes feud) with other circles.",

Nowhere in the Ironlands does such a city exist. In your dreams, you are the ruler of this city. Somehow, no matter how long it takes, you must make this vision a reality.",
        "option2": "Each of our communities has its own leader, called an overseer. Every seventh spring, the people affirm their current overseer or choose a new one. Some overseers wear the iron circlet reluctantly, while others thirst for power and gain it through schemes or threats.",

Will you discover the truth of the overseer’s illness and restore her to health?",

Though not nearly as impressive as the armies that once marched across the Old World, these forces are as well-trained and equipped as their communities can manage. The banners of the warbands are adorned with depictions of their Old World history and Ironland victories.",

Others act out of fear against those who they suspect of having power. However, most folk believe true magic—if it ever existed—is lost to us now.",

Do you aid this person in their quest, or act to prevent their blind hate from destroying more than just the beast?",

          "Quest": "An insurgent organization seeks to make knowledge available to all. To that end, they ask your aid in stealing important data from an outpost belonging to a corrupt organization. What information is held there? Why is it also important to you?"

          "Details": "Direct communication and transmissions beyond the near-space of a ship or outpost is impossible. Digital archives are available at larger outposts, but the information is not always up-to-date or reliable. Therefore, the most important communications and discoveries are carried by couriers who swear vows to see that data safely to its destination.",
          "Quest": "You discover a crippled courier ship. The pilot, carrying a critical and time-sensitive message, is dead. Where was the message bound, and why do you swear to see it to its destination?"

          "Details": "Because of their importance, Weave hubs are often targets for sabotage, and communication blackouts are not uncommon. Beyond the most populous sectors, travelers and outposts are still commonly isolated and entirely off the grid.",
          "Quest": "After years of isolation, the launch of a new data hub will connect several outposts to the Weave. But a person or faction seeks to stop it. What do they hope to gain by keeping those settlements in the dark? Why are you sworn to stop them?"

          "Details": "Much was lost in the Exodus, and what remains of our medical technologies and expertise is co-opted by the privileged and powerful. For most, advanced medical care is simply out of reach. When someone suffers a grievous injury, they'll often turn to a rigger for a makeshift mechanical solution.",
          "Quest": "A rigger is in desperate need of a rare technological artifact to create a life-saving medical device. Their patient is someone important to you, and won't survive more than a few days. What is the nature of this artifact, and what protects it?"
