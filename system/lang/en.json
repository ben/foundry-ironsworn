Nowhere in the Ironlands does such a city exist. In your dreams, you are the ruler of this city. Somehow, no matter how long it takes, you must make this vision a reality.",

          "Details": "Soon after our arrival, some displayed the ability to harness the Forge's energies. Today, mystics invoke this power to manipulate matter or see beyond the veils of our own universe. But this can be a corrupting force, and the most powerful mystics are respected and feared in equal measure.",

          "Description": "Much was lost when we came to the Forge. It is a dark age.",
          "Details": "The knowledge that remains is a commodity as valuable as the rarest resource. Information is collected, hoarded, and jealously guarded. Ships and outposts endure prolonged periods of isolation, and rumors or disinformation are used to gain advantage or undermine foes.",
          "Quest": "An insurgent organization seeks to make knowledge available to all. To that end, they ask your aid in stealing important data from an outpost belonging to a corrupt organization. What information is held there? Why is it also important to you?"

          "Description": "Information is life. We rely on spaceborne couriers to transport messages and data across the vast distances between settlements.",
          "Details": "Direct communication and transmissions beyond the near-space of a ship or outpost is impossible. Digital archives are available at larger outposts, but the information is not always up-to-date or reliable. Therefore, the most important communications and discoveries are carried by couriers who swear vows to see that data safely to its destination.",
          "Quest": "You discover a crippled courier ship. The pilot, carrying a critical and time-sensitive message, is dead. Where was the message bound, and why do you swear to see it to its destination?"

          "Description": "In settled domains, a network of data hubs called the Weave allow near-instantaneous communication and data-sharing between ships and outposts.",
          "Details": "Because of their importance, Weave hubs are often targets for sabotage, and communication blackouts are not uncommon. Beyond the most populous sectors, travelers and outposts are still commonly isolated and entirely off the grid.",
          "Quest": "After years of isolation, the launch of a new data hub will connect several outposts to the Weave. But a person or faction seeks to stop it. What do they hope to gain by keeping those settlements in the dark? Why are you sworn to stop them?"

          "Quest": "A community leader has fallen ill, stricken by a sickness eradicated in the years after the Exodus. A vaccine was once available, but the only remaining samples are held in a research outpost on a remote ocean world, long-ago seized by a dangerous foe."

          "Description": "To help offset a scarcity of medical supplies and knowledge, the resourceful technicians we call riggers create basic organ and limb replacements.",
          "Details": "Much was lost in the Exodus, and what remains of our medical technologies and expertise is co-opted by the privileged and powerful. For most, advanced medical care is simply out of reach. When someone suffers a grievous injury, they'll often turn to a rigger for a makeshift mechanical solution.",
          "Quest": "A rigger is in desperate need of a rare technological artifact to create a life-saving medical device. Their patient is someone important to you, and won't survive more than a few days. What is the nature of this artifact, and what protects it?"

They utilize mind-altering drugs to see the universe as a dazzling lattice of data, identifying trends and predicting outcomes with uncanny accuracy. But to gain this insight they sacrifice much of themselves.",

          "Description": "Here in the Forge, resources are too precious to support organized fighting forces or advanced weaponry.",
          "Details": "Weapons are simple and cheap. Starships are often cobbled together from salvage. Most communities rely on ragtag bands of poorly equipped conscripts or volunteers to defend their holdings, and raiders prowl the Forge in search of easy prey.",
          "Quest": "On a remote jungle world, settlers harvest a rare medicinal plant. Once a year, raiders come to claim a sizable portion of the crop. This year, the harvest was meager and they cannot bear the cost. With the raiders due to arrive in a matter of days, what will you do to protect the people of this outpost?"

          "Quest": "A detachment of mercenaries was sent to put down a rebellion on a mining settlement. Instead of following their orders, the soldiers now stand with the miners. What forced this sudden reversal? What will you do to aid these renegades as the full force of their former cohorts are arrayed against them?"
        },
        "option3": {
          "Description": "War never ends. Talented weaponsmiths and shipwrights craft deadly, high-tech tools of destruction. Dominant factions wield mighty fleets and battle-hardened troops.",
          "Details": "Those in power have access to weapons of horrific destructive potential. Skirmishes and wars flare across the settled domains, and most are pawns or casualties in these destructive campaigns.",
          "Quest": "A weaponsmith created an experimental ship-mounted weapon, the Null Cannon, able to fracture the very bonds of reality. Now, they hope to undo their work before the cannon is brought to bear. What caused this change of heart? How are you involved?"

          "Description": "Life in the Forge was seeded and engineered by the Essentia, ancient entities who enact their inscrutable will in this galaxy.",
          "Details": "The Essentia are the architects of life within the Forge. These omniscient beings are rarely encountered, and have powers and purpose beyond our comprehension. Some worship them. Others resist or rebel against them. But trying to defy the will of the Essentia is like standing at the shore of an ocean to thwart the tide. They are inevitable.",
          "Quest": "An eccentric xenologist believes the genomes of life within the Forge don't just show commonalities—they are in fact a coded message from the Essentia. But there are still significant gaps, and the truth may only be revealed with additional samples. What is your stake in this project?"

          "Details": "Ascendancy vaults can appear spontaneously, washed up like flotsam in the tides of time. Their gravity and atmospheres pay no heed to natural laws. Some are corrupted and ruined. Others are unmarred and intact. Some are both at once. They are chaos.",

          "Details": "When you travel the depths of the Forge, be wary. Death is not always the end to our suffering. Some say we are cursed by those who did not survive the cataclysm, and the veil between life and death is forever weakened.

          "Quest": "A group of settlers established a home in an abandoned orbital station under the light of a white dwarf star.
