Jednak nie można było uciec przed plagą. Na wielu statkach udało się opanować chorobę dzięki bezwzględnym środkom - wyrzucano za burtę każdego, kto wykazywał najmniejsze objawy. Inne statki zostały stracone na zawsze. W końcu ci, którzy przeżyli, znaleźli Żelazne Ziemie i uczynili z nich swój nowy dom. Niektórzy twierdzą, że na zawsze pozostaniemy przeklęci przez tych, których zostawiliśmy za sobą.",

        "option3": "Stary Świat nie mógł nas dłużej utrzymać. Byliśmy zbyt liczni. Wycięliśmy lasy. Nasze uprawy zwiędły na jałowej ziemi. Miasta i wsie przepełnione były zdesperowanymi, głodnymi ludźmi. Drobni watażkowie walczyli o resztki. Rzuciliśmy swój los na morze i znaleźliśmy Żelazne Ziemie. Nowy świat. Świeży początek.",

Docierają do nas wieści o jednym statku, świeżo przybyłym przez rozległy ocean, który osiadł na skałach Wysp Barierowych. Gdy słyszysz nazwę tego statku, przysięgasz odkryć los jego pasażerów.

Niektórzy twierdzą, że są tak stare jak świat. Niektórzy, jak na przykład Żelazni Kapłani, czczą je i składają na nie przysięgi. Większość uznaje je za znak ostrzegawczy i pospiesznie podąża swoją drogą, gdy natknie się na jeden z nich. Filary nie matowieją i nawet najostrzejsze ostrze nie jest w stanie ich zarysować.",

        "option3": "Przekształciliśmy Żelazne Krainy w dom. Wioski w obrębie Przystani połączone są dobrze wydeptanymi drogami. Karawany handlowe podróżują między osadami z Przystani a tymi z odległych regionów. Mimo to, duża część tej ziemi jest nieokiełznana.",
        "quest3": "Karawany są zmuszane do płacenia za przejazd drogą handlową. Ta opłata, stanowiąca jedną czwartą przewożonego towaru, pozostawia kilka społeczności bez wystarczających zapasów na zimę. Kto stawia takie żądania? Jak naprawisz sytuację?"

Nowhere in the Ironlands does such a city exist. In your dreams, you are the ruler of this city. Somehow, no matter how long it takes, musisz make this vision a reality.",
        "option2": "Each of our communities has its own leader, called an overseer. Every seventh spring, the people affirm their current overseer or choose a new one. Some overseers wear the iron circlet reluctantly, while others thirst for power and gain it through schemes or threats.",
        "quest2": "An overseer has fallen ill. She is sure to die without help, and the illness is unknown to the village healer. Poison, or perhaps even foul magic, is suspected. The families in the community are now at each other’s throats as they position their preferred candidates to take up the iron circlet. Will you discover the truth of the overseer’s illness and restore her to health?",

Though not nearly as impressive as the armies that once marched across the Old World, these forces are as well-trained and equipped as their communities can manage. The banners of the warbands are adorned with depictions of their Old World history and Ironland victories.",

Others act out of fear against those who they suspect of having power. However, most folk believe true magic—if it ever existed—is lost to us now.",
