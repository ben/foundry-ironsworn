# Changelog

## Next Release

## 1.22.1

- Fixed a bug where pronouns and callsign wouldn't save ([#870](https://github.com/ben/foundry-ironsworn/pull/870))

## 1.22.0

- Drop support for Foundry v10, we only support v11 and up now.
- Add a hook that fires when custom oracle registration is ready ([#864](https://github.com/ben/foundry-ironsworn/pull/864))
- Organize compendium packs into folders
- Improve appearance of v11 compendium sidebar and popouts with the "Phosphor" theme
- Include most of Starforged's oracle icons in the `foundry-ironsworn/assets` directory -- use them as symbolic tokens, map pins, etc
- Make player condition meters and momentum available as bar displays on actor tokens
- Under the hood changes:
  - All meter fields are now objects with `max` and `value` properties, rather than a single number value
  - Migrate all actor and item subclasses to DataModel API. This brings several benefits such as stricter run-time validation which improve the reliability of the data used in `foundry-ironsworn`, and near-instant data migrations. It also makes it _much_ easier to implement data migrations for new features in the future.
  - Refactor all `RollTable`s and oracle rolls to use a single standardized pipeline (with `foundry-ironsworn`-style table roll messages) by default; certain kinds of results will fall back to FVTT-style messages instead.
