Deadly creatures or determined foes often lair within, but it is the water that is your ever-present enemy. The chill and damp seep into your bones. The tides and upland flooding can bring a torrent of water with little warning. You plunge desperately through submerged passages, praying that an opening will provide a pocket of air.\n\nThis is a realm of water and stone, cold and darkness. You are not welcome here.",
