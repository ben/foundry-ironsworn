// until this chromium issue with paint-order is resolved, text-stroke is functionally useless: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=815111
// yes, i am bitter, because even safari has supported it for ~4 years at this point :)
// in the mean time, we can fake a 1px solid outside stroke by stacking text-shadow or drop-shadow filters. be cautious with overusing it; they're not blurred, so the computational cost isn't *too* bad, but that's still 6x as many shadows as we want to be drawing.
// if you wanted this + a soft shadow, just append the other shadow with a separator.
