      - key: Sheet
        title: Move/Oracle Sheet
        content: This is the window that provides easy access to moves and oracles.

      - key: MoveCategory
        title: Move Categories
        content: Click on a category title to expand that category and show all of the moves. Click on one of the moves to expand its description.

      - key: MoveButtons
        title: Move Shortcuts
        content: |
          Up here you'll see shortcut buttons.

          The first one is a shortcut to "roll this move," and will open the rolling dialog with some details pre-filled for you. It's only available if this move has a roll associated with it -- some, like Pay the Price, do not have an action/challenge roll, so this button will be disabled.

          The second one is a shortcut to "roll the oracle," and immediately rolls on an oracle table. It's only available if the move has exactly one oracle to roll.

          The third one sends a copy of the description to the chat sidebar.

      - key: MoveLink
        title: Move Links
        content: Clicking on a link to another move will expand it and scroll it into view.

      - key: OraclesTab
        title: Oracles Tab
        content: The second tab displays oracles, random tables to spark your inspiration.

      - key: OracleCategory
        title: Oracle Tree
        content: The oracles are organized into a directory structure. Click anywhere on a category line to expand it and display its contents.

      - key: OracleRow
        title: Oracle Controls
        content: Click the <i class="fas fa-eye"></i> icon to display a preview of the oracle table, or click anywhere else on the line to draw a result from the table and display it in chat.

      - key: OracleChatMessage
        title: Oracle Results
        content: |
          When you roll an oracle, a chat card is displayed. The highlighted row is the rolled result, and the adjacent rolls are also displayed.

          If you hover your mouse over the message, you'll see buttons appear, which let you copy a result's text to your clipboard, or re-roll on the same oracle table.

      - key: End
        title: Move Sheet
        content: That's all for now. Look for the <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question"></i> button in other sheet title bars for more information on how they work.
