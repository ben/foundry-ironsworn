// TODO dataforged has a key for move colours...., but they appear to have changed significantly since the last time i updated them! they'll be fixed for 2.0, but until then, here's a workaround.
export enum MoveCategoryColor {
	Adventure = '#206087',
	Combat = '#818992',
	Connection = '#4A5791',
	// non-canonical (ironsworn); uses color from 'Exploration'
	Delve = '#427FAA',
	Exploration = '#427FAA',
	// non-canonical (ironsworn); uses color from 'Legacy'.
	Failure = '#4F5A69',
	Fate = '#8F477B',
	Legacy = '#4F5A69',
	Quest = '#805A90',
	// non-canonical (ironsworn); uses color from 'Recover'
	Rarity = '#488B44',
	Recover = '#488B44',
	// non-canonical (ironsworn); uses color from 'Connection'
	Relationship = '#4A5791',
