They have long legs, a segmented tail, and large, serrated claws.</p>\n<p>Their carapace changes color to perfectly match their environment, making them nearly invisible among rocks or ice. When potential prey strays near, a shroud crab uses its powerful legs to spring at its victim. Then, it wraps around them in a horrible embrace, stabbing and slashing with its claws and barbed tail.</p>\n<p>Packs of shroud crabs are known to work in tandem to bring down large prey. Some report seeing mighty elk engulfed by these voracious creatures. On occasion, the body of a missing Ironlander is found with their flesh picked clean to the bones.</p>\n\n<blockquote>Quest Starter: <p>A vengeful @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironsworndelvefoes.084f870452cf433a]{husk} curses a seaside settlement and summons a horde of shroud crabs to overrun the place in a flood of clattering legs and snapping claws. The husk dwells within an @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironsworndelvethemes.0d16f80541657b28]{Infested} @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironsworndelvedomains.40439d5f28e56495]{Sea Cave}, protected by other shroud crabs. There, she prepares an even more horrible show of her powerâ€”one which will threaten villages up and down the Ragged Coast.</p></blockquote>",
