They are most often encountered as particles of light which coalesce into a luminous humanoid or animal form.</p>\n<p>They are drawn to those who need guidance. For wayward travelers and seekers of hidden things, a glimmer will make a silent offer of passage. Relief from the dangers of the Ironlands or a quick journey to a distant destination is a tempting invitation, but not without its own price.</p>\n<p>The path the glimmer reveals is not wholly of our world. It can descend into the past, or climb into the future. It can wend its way across other lands and through strange realities. These trails are navigated not just by the glimmer, but by ancient, baneful things beyond comprehension.</p>\n<p>If you accept a glimmer’s guidance, steel yourself for the journey. Envision the places and people that give you hope, and you may find yourself among them. But do not be distracted. The temptations and terrors along the way can lead all but the most resolute astray. To be lost along a glimmer’s path is to remain lost—perhaps forever.</p>\n\n<blockquote>Quest Starter: <p>Someone you love entered a @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironsworndelvethemes.cf94fb4e6e77ed17]{Corrupted} @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironsworndelvedomains.bd208fdcb58e5485]{Shadowfen} in search of a glimmer’s aid.
