They retain their reasoning and intelligence, but are driven obsessively by this singular purpose.</p>\n<p>A wight’s steadfast will can delay their inevitable physical decay for decades, but they are marked by death nonetheless. They have the pallor of a freshly entombed corpse, with sallow skin stretched thin over bones. They often hide their corrupted features behind iron burial masks.</p>\n<p>Some wights wield the armor and weapons they favored in life, and are relentless, unyielding fighters. Others master dark rituals, empowered by the knowledge of what lies beyond our mortal realm.</p>\n<p>A wight who forsakes their vow will continue their tortured existence as a bonewalker, fated to lurk forever at the precipice of death.</p>\n\n<blockquote>Quest Starter: <p>A wight is in search of the person it is sworn to protect, now held in a @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironsworndelvethemes.58ffd0a1f84094d0]{Fortified} @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironsworndelvedomains.a0ed0d5794e094be]{Stronghold}.
