Some are animal-like, or combine the characteristics of different creatures. Others are bizarre aberrations seemingly born of chaos. A few even possess twisted mockeries of human features.</p>\n<p>They are rare beasts, but dwell in every region and environment of the Ironlands, from the dark waters of the Ragged Coast to the icy plains of the Shattered Wastes. Often, they protect ancient ruins, forgotten relics, and other secrets. They watch and wait, and show no mercy to those who trespass in their domain.</p>\n<p>We do not know the origin of the nightspawn. They are enigmatic creatures, rarely emerging from their dark lairs except during the long nights of winter. Is it the latent magic of these lands which gives them life? Have they passed through the veil from some other realm? Perhaps some questions are best left unanswered.</p>\n\n<blockquote>Quest Starter: <p>The first settlers, your forebears, told tales of a great nightspawn at the heart of a @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironsworndelvethemes.d267fd935459da97]{Ravaged} @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironsworndelvedomains.b4157fd5116746cc]{Ruin}. According to those stories, it guards a pool of life-giving water. Any who have since tried to plunder that place have not returned. Or they have come back broken in mind or body. What now compels you to delve into this site?</p></blockquote>",
