It can appear in any season or in any weather, but is larger and more powerful in the depths of winter. It is drawn to the warmth of living beings, and seeks to douse that life as one would snuff out a candle.</p>\n<p>A tempest’s true nature is a mystery. Is it intelligent, or just a force of nature?
