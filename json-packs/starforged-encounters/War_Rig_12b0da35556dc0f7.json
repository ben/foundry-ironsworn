These mobile fortresses vary in form and functionâ€”some use hover tech, others thunder across the landscape on wheels or treads, a few trudge along on articulated metal legs. All are heavily armored, bristling with weapons, and fiercely defended by the bandits. The mere sight of the rig as it approaches is often enough for a settlement to surrender and agree to any demand.</p>\n\n<blockquote>Quest Starter: <p>In a far-flung sector, a titanic creature threatens a key planetside settlement. The only possible defense against this beast is the mighty war rig belonging to a clan of scrap bandits. But can you convince the bandits to risk their rig to protect the settlers? If so, what will they demand in return?</p></blockquote>",
