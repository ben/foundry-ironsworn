When in doubt, burn it and deal with the aftermath that comes with generous applications of fire. A ship or settlement with a large outbreak is likely too far gone and best abandoned, although some suggest every infection has its source; if you somehow find and destroy the heart of a technoplasm infestation, can you kill it entirely?</p>\n\n<blockquote>Quest Starter: <p>An outcast cult believes technoplasm is the ultimate synthesis of machine and flesh.
