Their broad, scalloped mantle unfurls to catch updrafts as sinuous feelers extract water, minerals, and organisms from the dense cloud layers below.</p>\n<p>A roost's wide cap and warm, glowing core shelters a complex ecosystem of other lifeforms. A few of these resident creatures live out their entire lives within the refuge of a single roost; others come and go as they hunt within the Jovian skies or migrate among distant habitats.</p>\n<p>Roosts are enormous and long-lived, but fragile. In a symbiotic trade for shelter, the inhabitants provide protection against large predators and other threats, and their discarded food and waste help fuel the roost's sluggish metabolism.</p>\n<p>As a roost navigates the currents and eddies of the Jovian atmosphere, the expansion and contraction of its internal air bladders is heard as a deep, resounding call. As other roosts respond, the shared, plaintive song reverberates among the clouds.</p>\n\n<blockquote>Quest Starter: <p>Sky roosts are dying. A disease is spreading among them, threatening the delicate ecosystem of their world. What human operations do you suspect lie at the heart of this sickness?</p></blockquote>\n\n<h2>Variants</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>@Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.starforgedencounters.578dd708f06d7801]{Roost Swarm}</li>\n</ul>",
