Often found in places of great destruction or suffering—battlefields, derelict ships, the ruins of forsaken settlements—the risen protect their place of death fiercely and eternally.</p>\n<p>To say the risen hate the living is untrue; to hate something would require sentience, emotion. Risen are robotic in their duties, automatic in their violence. They wield the weapons they carried in life to better harm their foes, and when that fails, they rake with bony, claw-like fingers. Their garments hang in bloodstained tatters. Their emaciated flesh, stretched taught over their misshapen bones, only hints at the living, breathing human they were before this curse befell them.</p>\n<p>Many spacers spin tales of shambling risen encountered on abandoned colony worlds or derelict space cruisers. But perhaps most horrifyingly, it’s said the risen can survive decades in the vacuum of space before latching onto a passing ship or attacking engineers making exterior repairs.</p>\n\n<blockquote>Quest Starter: <p>Hundreds died in an industrial accident within an orbital facility, and are said to now be twice-born as risen. Triggering a reactor meltdown will obliterate this place and put its undead inhabitants to rest. Why are you sworn to see it done?</p></blockquote>\n\n<h2>Variants</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>@Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.starforgedencounters.f22b523e622deb5f]{Chimera}</li>\n</ul>",
