They are fierce protectors of their realm, driven by a zealous devotion to their gods. Their eyes are large and glossy black.

They emerge from their sunken lairs to swarm over ships or coastal settlements, dragging their victims into the depths. As night falls, the people of seaside villages light their torches, ward their gates, and keep an eye to the waters.</p>\n\n<blockquote>Quest Starter: <p>Sailors speak in hushed tones of a large merrow, its skin translucent white, wielding a wicked stone blade.

This merrow and its clan take no prisoners, instead performing bloodletting rituals aboard the ships they attack. What is the origin of this leader? What is the purpose of these violent rituals?</p></blockquote>",
