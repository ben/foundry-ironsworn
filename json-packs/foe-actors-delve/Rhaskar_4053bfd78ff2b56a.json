It hunts along shorelines, lurks beneath ice, or tracks the frigid wastes in search of prey. Some rhaskar have even been known to attack ships in coastal waters. It is a highly territorial creature, and does not abide trespassers within its domain.</p>\n<p>With its mane of dorsal fur and long, angular head, the rhaskar looks like a fusion of shark and bear—and embodies the strength and cunning of both. It is the uncaring ferocity of these cold northern realms given form.</p>\n\n<blockquote>Quest Starter: <p>Settlements and ships along the northern expanse of the Ragged Coast face repeated attacks from a large rhaskar. The creature appears amidst a fierce snowstorm, makes it savage assault, and fades back into the blizzard like a ghost. It seems to act out of a pure compulsion to cause terror and inflict violence rather than any need for food. A hunter tracked it to a @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironsworndelvethemes.3a633d3ce6079711]{Wild} @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironsworndelvedomains.2a5fe65347585d25]{Frozen Cavern}. But they heeded the warning of a pile of bones at the entrance and refused to enter that place.</p></blockquote>",
