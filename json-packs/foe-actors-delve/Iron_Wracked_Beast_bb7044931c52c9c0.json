It inflicts creatures of the wilds and transforms their flesh slowly to iron. These pitiful but powerful beasts are scarred by patches of metal flesh within ragged, weeping wounds. The iron is like a parasite, devouring the host as it torments them with unstoppable pain and insatiable hunger. Their howls echo with animalistic agony and the clangor of hammer against anvil.</p>\n<p>In time, the Blight takes too much, and the beast dies while it is still more flesh than iron.
