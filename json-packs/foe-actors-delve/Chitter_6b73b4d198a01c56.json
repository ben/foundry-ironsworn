They stand half the height of an Ironlander, and move on six segmented legs.</p>\n<p>They are primarily scavengers, using their keen sense of smell to locate and retrieve carcasses above or below ground. Instead of eyes, chitters have three thumb-sized holes in the center of their heads through which they issue a distinctive twittering sound. This call is used to communicate with others of its kind and to help visualize their surroundingsâ€”much like bats find their way in darkness.</p>\n<p>They are covered in a rigid shell, and their mandibles are as sharp and destructive as a finely forged blade. They are not necessarily hostile, but will aggressively defend their nests or fight to secure a food source.</p>\n<p>As a last resort, a chitter may attack by spewing the contents of its stomach in a noxious spray, leaving all but the hardiest of Ironlanders temporarily blinded and retching.</p>\n\n<blockquote>Quest Starter: <p>An Ironlander scavenged a relic from an @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironsworndelvethemes.94397e5c9fb65a81]{Ancient} @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironsworndelvedomains.95455d1a10c32b53]{Underkeep}, bringing it back to their settlement. Now, as if lured by this object, chitters attack in overwhelming waves. The walls will not hold much longer.
