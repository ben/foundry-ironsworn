It has a lean, powerful form, is armed with curving claws and fangs, and moves unseen through the half-light of the jungle thanks to its sleek, blue-gray fur.</p>\n<p>Unnervingly, the howlcatâ€™s heavy skull possesses no eyes. Instead, it is crowned by large ears and a glossy bioacoustic organ. Through its distinct, chilling call, it uses echolocation to perceive its surroundings and stalk its prey with uncanny precision.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself hunted by a howlcat, beware the moment when its calls fall silent; it is about to strike.</p>\n\n<blockquote>Quest Starter: <p>A long-abandoned settlement, now reclaimed by the jungle, holds something of value or importance. But there is no clear landing site near the settlement, and the surrounding lands are home to a pack of fearsome howlcats. What is it you seek in that forsaken place, and how will you avoid becoming a howlcat's next meal?</p></blockquote>\n\n<h2>Variants</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>@Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.starforgedencounters.1bf8f6f16f4d0079]{Howlcat pack}</li>\n</ul>",
