These restless phantasms may be tied to a location, an object, or even a person.</p>\n<p>Their form and nature varies. Some ghosts seek absolution. Others want revenge. Many are so sundered by a traumatic or unjust death that only a tormented, destructive shell of their former selves remain.</p>\n<p>Ghosts might manifest in a physical form or assault with physical force, but they cannot be defeated through violence. To vanquish a ghost, you must instead find the key to unshackle them from our reality.</p>\n\n<blockquote>Quest Starter: <p>A ghost haunts your starship.
