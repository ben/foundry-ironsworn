What's left is discarded or sold on the black market. A typical pirate cutlass is a haphazard collection of parts, splashed with the colors and sigils of their commanders, built for speed and brutish power. The imposing sight of one of these fierce vessels is enough to send a chill through the heart of even the boldest spacer.</p>\n\n<blockquote>Quest Starter: <p>A drift pirate captain seizes an experimental new e-drive, and uses it to stalk ships with deadly efficiency.
