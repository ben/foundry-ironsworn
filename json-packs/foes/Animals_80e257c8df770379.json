  "description": "animals are the mundane creatures which dwell in the Ironlands. Some animals are native to these lands; others were also common in the @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironsworntruths.8e55416353faa29f]{Old World}.\n\nMost wild animals are skittish and do not pose a threat to humans. Those creatures have no rank, and can be attacked or interacted with using appropriate moves. For example, @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironswornmoves.8d90dd472856be27]{Resupply} can represent hunting for deer or small game.\n\nA few notable exceptions—predators, aggressive creatures, and animals trained to fight—are noted here.",
