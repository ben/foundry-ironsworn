Among the dead is someone important to you. Who is it? You have vowed to send this beast back to the depths, but doing so will require a mythic weaponâ€”The Abyssal Harpoon, an @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironsworntruths.8e55416353faa29f]{Old World} artifact said to be carved from the bones of a long-dead sea god. Where is this weapon rumored to be held?</p></blockquote>",
