They are all-too-common in the Flooded Lands or in wetlands within the Hinterlands and Deep Wilds.</p>\n<p>They will eat almost anything, including carrion and waste. Our grain stores and pantries are an easy target for a hungry pack, who will dig tunnels or chew through walls to get at the food. They will also try to make a meal out of living preyâ€”deer, cattle, or even an unlucky Ironlander. It is said that a swarm of marsh rats can kill a horse and reduce it to bone in a matter of hours.</p>\n\n<blockquote>Quest Starter: <p>Marsh rats raided the stores of an isolated settlement. How will you ensure the Ironlanders have enough food to survive the coming winter?</p></blockquote>",
