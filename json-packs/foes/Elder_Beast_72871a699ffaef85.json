They are primarily solitary creatures, though elder wolves have been known to lead a pack of common wolves. They are not aggressive, but are protective of their lands and the creatures within it. Some say they are avatars of the old gods and as long-lived as the oldest trees.</p>\n\n<blockquote>Quest Starter: <p>An elder wolf, white as snow, appears to you in a dream. When you wake, the memory of its piercing gaze lingers. Is the vision a dark portent or a promise? Why are you compelled to seek this beast out?</p></blockquote>",
