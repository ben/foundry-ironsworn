  "description": "This table provides pairs of given and family names. When choosing or rolling for a character name, select a pair or mix and match from among the options in a row. Given and family names can often be reversed, or used independently as stand-alone names.\n\nThis table also includes monikers, one to each row. Not all characters have monikers, but sailors are often given a nickname by their shipmates, or adopt one of their own. Monikers can be used as a stand-alone name (for example, “Redbeard” or “Stormcrow”) or paired with a given name or family name (“Crimson Jack” or “Hardtack Hobbs”). Roll or select an appropriate moniker as you like.",
