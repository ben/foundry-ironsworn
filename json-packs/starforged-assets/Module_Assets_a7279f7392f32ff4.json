They can be shared with allies, but only if it's practical for them to make use of it (not everyone may know how to use a RESEARCH LAB).\n\nWhen you @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.starforgedmoves.3782f1b3c8ca8b88]{Withstand Damage} and score a miss, you can mark a module as broken to offset further danger for your STARSHIP. Flip the card over to indicate its broken state. A broken module cannot be used until you successfully @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.starforgedmoves.eece9a67d1961f70]{Repair} it.",
