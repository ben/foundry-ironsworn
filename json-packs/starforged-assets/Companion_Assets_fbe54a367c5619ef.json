When you gain a companion, give them a name and envision their look and personality.\n\nCompanions utilize a health meter that can be reduced if an outcome puts them in harm's way. When your companion faces harm, make the @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.starforgedmoves.d34cdf2408cd22b6]{Companion Takes a Hit} move. When their health is at 0, they are in danger of being killed or destroyed.",
