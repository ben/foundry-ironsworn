  "description": "If you encounter a trap within a site, use these oracles to better understand the nature or function of this obstacle. Roll once for an @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironsworndelveoracles.963b7bb06c332342]{Event} and once for a @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironsworndelveoracles.4135d73dae285c7f]{Component}, and interpret the response as appropriate to the situation and environment. A trap might be a physical, supernatural, or an ambush by a denizen.\n\nIf you are in a position to overcome or avoid the trap, make moves to see what happens. A simple trap might be dealt with in a single action, such as through the @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironswornmoves.c8bacc17f73d3103]{Face Danger} move. A complex trap could be represented as a scene challenge (*Ironsworn Core*, page 234).",
