  "description": "Use the Combat Event oracles to answer questions about the actions of a foe or enemy force. You can use these oracles instead of—or in addition to—the @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironswornoracles.1fa4912b675a7c96]{Combat Action} oracle.\n\nRoll once each on the @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironsworndelveoracles.ff2d8060b079cee0]{Method} oracle and the @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironsworndelveoracles.419b2fc99e694f51]{Target} oracle. Then, interpret the response as appropriate to the current situation and the nature of your foe.\n\nFor example, you are fighting a rhaskar, a bear-like beast. It has initiative, and you want to know what it does next. You @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironswornmoves.aba3e44b7e810c0f]{Ask the Oracle}, rolling @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironsworndelveoracles.ff2d8060b079cee0]{Method} and @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironsworndelveoracles.419b2fc99e694f51]{Target}. The oracle responds, “Await Weakness.” You envision the rhaskar circling you, its keen eyes narrowing as it looks for an opening in your defenses. You must @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironswornmoves.c8bacc17f73d3103]{Face Danger} to avoid being outmaneuvered.",
