  "description": "*Ironsworn* characters are assumed to be skilled fighters. Even without a combat talent, you can wield weapons and perform combat moves (page 78). A combat talent reflects a particular area of expertise, and gives you additional options and bonuses.\n\nCombat talent assets typically require you to wield a specific weapon, as noted in the asset text. For example, if you are a **Shield-Bearer** and don’t have a shield at the ready, you can’t use the asset’s abilities.",
