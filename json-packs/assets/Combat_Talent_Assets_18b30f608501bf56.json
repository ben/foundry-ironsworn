  "description": "*Ironsworn* characters are assumed to be skilled fighters. Even without a combat talent, you can wield weapons and perform @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironswornmoves.19defd673fdc3970]{combat moves}. A combat talent reflects a particular area of expertise, and gives you additional options and bonuses.\n\nCombat talent assets typically require you to wield a specific weapon, as noted in the asset text. For example, if you are a @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironswornassets.5e86f277a23f1113]{Shield-Bearer} and don’t have a shield at the ready, you can’t use the asset’s abilities.",
