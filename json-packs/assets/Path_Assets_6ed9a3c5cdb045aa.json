  "description": "Paths represent your background, interests, training, and skills. They provide mechanical and narrative advantages, but also reflect who you are and how you interact with the world. For example, a @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironswornassets.55a3b0ee5d864242]{Ritualist} would likely have a different outlook than a @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironswornassets.bc1d497da5950da5]{Veteran}. Choosing both those paths can reflect an evolution of your character or an interesting background.",
