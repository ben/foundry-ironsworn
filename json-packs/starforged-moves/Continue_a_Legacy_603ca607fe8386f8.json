You may immediately mark up to half their earned progress (round down) on this quest.\n  * Rebuild a connection: Name one of the former character's connections, and envision how time or circumstances have changed them in a dramatic way.

When you first visit that place, envision how it has changed or is endangered. Then, mark two ticks on your discoveries legacy track.\n\nFor each __miss__, choose one.\n\n  * Deal with the aftermath: Envision how one of your former character's foes has gained power or influence.\n  * Switch loyalties: Envision how you begin in opposition to your former character's beliefs, goals, or allegiances.\n  * Open Pandora's Box: Envision how an advancement or discovery has unleashed unexpectedly dire consequences.",
