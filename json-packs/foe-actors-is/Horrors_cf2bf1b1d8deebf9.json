  "description": "Horrors are supernatural entities. In the @Compendium[foundry-ironsworn.ironsworntruths.8e55416353faa29f]{Old World}, they were superstition and legend. Here, they are nightmares made real. The Ironlands is fertile ground for darkness and evil to take hold, spawning these undead beings of pure vengeance or mindless hate.\n\nMany horrors can be temporarily defeated through physical attacks, but cannot be killed. They are beyond death.",
