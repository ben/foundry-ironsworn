Their cannons unleash devastating barrages against rivals or raiders, and their crews wield muskets and blades to defend their decks. Some commanders plot a course through hazardous waters with chart and sextant, while others rely on a deeper understanding of sea and sky. But above all else, we trust in the loyalty of our shipmates and the strength of our vows.",
