        "Description": "Pirates give no quarter to seagoing targets and raze settlements on a whim. Their loyalty is only to crew and captain, but even that bond is fragile. Ritualized duels to decide the captaincy or settle disputes are common, and a long-lived marauder is a rare thing. If you come upon a gray-haired pirate, be wary; they have outwitted sailors better than you a thousand times over.",

Pirates do not attack indiscriminately, and give quarter to those who ask for it. They are nevertheless vilified as barbarous murderers by trade guilds, imperial governors, and other powers in the isles. In some ways, this reputation serves them; fear is more powerful than the mightiest cannons or the sharpest swords.",
